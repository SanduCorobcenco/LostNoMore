# Lost No More
Have you ever visited a city and felt lost, not know what to do? Well feel lost no more. With this user friendly application, you can view a map, top locations, and the forecast of the city searched. It uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and two [Google API's](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search), to retrieve data for the inputed city. As avid travelers, we wanted to create an application that has a map, top sites, and weather.
