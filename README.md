# Project Description:
In the project Lost No More we created a visitor guide for cities. 
The Application contains:
* A map of the city that is input in the search bar
* Top locations to visit in the city listed on the map
* The current 5 day forcast for the city
* Descriptions for the places listed below the map
* A link to our group's git hub pages in the footer
* A description of the app in the header

# User Story
As a user, I want to be able to look up a map of a city I am traveling to or in.

I want to see top sites within the city on the map, and a description of the top sites below the map, including images of those top sites.

I want to be able to see the 5 day forecast for the city I am visiting next to the map of top sites.
