# Lost No More
Have you ever visited a city and felt lost, not know what to do? Well feel lost no more. With this user friendly application, you can view a map, top locations, and the forecast of the city searched. It uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Google API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search), to retrieve data for the inputed city. As avid travelers, we wanted to create an application that has a map, top sites, and weather.

Once Accepted you will see a message at the end that says:

## Usage

When the user wants to search for a city, enter the city and hit search. Then the map, top sites buttons, and weather will populate for that city.

Click on which top site category you would like to see, campgrounds, lodging, cafes, gas stations, and restaurants. 
When selected the top six sites will appear from that category. They will also populate on the map.

    The following tutorials were used: 
        * https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp : used for modal 
        *
    
We used the url: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com  for our proxy url. It helps bypass the cors header, helps the google top sites work.
